Q:  Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

    A: We can look at it as React for your backend. It adds extra functionality like 
       Routing and Middleware support. Allows us to build RESTfull web services 
       that work with JSON.


Q:  Describe Middleware?

    A: It allows us to add functionality/features to our endpoint calls before the whole function
       is run, so it can actually act as a checkpoint as well.



Q:  Describe a Resource?

    A:  Resource can be data stored in a backend database.



Q:  What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

    A: Our API can return specific Status codes that we choose, as well it can return Json Objects.



Q:  How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

    A: Using express.Router() can help us partition our code into different parts, and importing them wherever needed.
